# Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Q-learning
This is the first version of a Python implementation of the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors using the Q-learning algorithm. The Q-learning algorithm is a reinforcement learning technique that learns an optimal policy for an agent by estimating the expected rewards for each state-action pair.
